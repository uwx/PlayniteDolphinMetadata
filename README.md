# Playnite Wii/GameCube GameTDB Metadata Extension

Adds support for loading [GameTDB](https://www.gametdb.com/) metadata for Nintendo Wii and Nintendo GameCube to [Playnite](https://playnite.link/).

## Installation

[Download the .pext](https://github.com/uwx/PlayniteDolphinMetadata/releases) and open it with Playnite.

You have to restart Playnite after installing the extension.

## Usage

### For ROMs using the .ISO, .CISO, .WBFS, .GCZ, .WBI, .WDF, .WIA, .WAD, .RVZ or .FST format

These will work out of the box, so simply use Edit Game Details > Download Metadata to download with GameTDB as a metadata source. You can also
configure it to be used on all metadata downloads by going to Settings > Metadata

## Configuration

You can choose the preferred language and cover art style to be downloaded in the extension settings. If a cover is not found with the matching
parameters, the extension will attempt to find any cover.
